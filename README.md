Crunchy Math - Mathematical Expression Parser
===
Crunchy Math executes arbitrary inline mathematical expressions. Its architecture it's very flexible, providing a simple memory model to store data and can be easily extended with custom functions.

Its main features are:
 - Basic arithmentic operators (+, -, *, /)
 - Trigonometric functions and angle units converions
 - Vector values
 - Custom functions (Pow, Sqrt, Rnd, Log, Round, ...)
 - Constants
 - Indirect Eval operator
 - Stack memory and variables
 - Easy extensible model for new operators

The aim of this project is to:
 - Learn how to build a mathematical expression executor
   - infix and postfix notations
   - simple execution VM
   - no formal grammar
 - Getting introduced to Unit Testing and to JUnti
 - Apply design patterns and OOD considerations
 - Deepen the knowledge of the Java Language
 - Learn some math libraries from Apache Common and Apfloat
 - Getting exposed to numerical analysis
